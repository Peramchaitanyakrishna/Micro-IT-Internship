<b>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</b> <br>
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with
 their symbol (X or O) in an attempt to get three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or
 diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or if all squares are filled without a winner, resulting in a
 draw. It’s a simple yet strategic game that can be played on paper or as a digital application.
